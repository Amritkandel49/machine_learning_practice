# 🧠 Machine Learning Practice

This repository contains my personal notes and code as I learn machine learning by following the excellent tutorials from [CampusX](https://www.youtube.com/@campusx-official).

I'm coding along with the videos and pushing my work regularly as part of my learning journey. The focus is on understanding key ML concepts and applying them using Python and libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn.
